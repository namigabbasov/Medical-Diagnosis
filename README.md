                                                          # Medical Diagnosis Projects

## Overview
Welcome to the Medical Diagnosis Projects repository! This repository contains replication files and resources for projects focused on leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to address challenges in medical diagnosis. The aim is to develop and share innovative, AI-driven solutions that enhance diagnostic accuracy, accessibility, and scalability in healthcare.

# Key Features
Medical Imaging Analysis:

Classification and severity grading of diseases using advanced models such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Applications include retinal disease detection (e.g., diabetic retinopathy) and other imaging-based diagnostics.
AI for Clinical Diagnosis:

Predictive models for early disease detection and risk stratification using structured clinical data.
Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure transparency and trust in diagnostic predictions.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Healthcare:

Text analysis of electronic health records (EHRs) and medical reports.
Sentiment analysis and keyword extraction from patient data to understand care quality and trends.
Multimodal Data Integration:

Combining imaging, clinical, and genomic data to create holistic diagnostic tools.
Exploring advanced techniques for feature integration and model interpretability.
