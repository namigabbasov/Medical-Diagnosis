## Medical Diagnosis Projects[in Progress]

# Overview
Welcome to my Medical Diagnosis Projects repository! In addition to social science and digital humanities research, I am very interesed in applying machine learning and AI-driven approaches to medical problems. This repository contains replication files and resources for projects focused on leveraging AI to address those challenges in medical diagnosis. The aim is to develop and share innovative, AI-driven solutions that enhance diagnostic accuracy, accessibility, and scalability in healthcare.

# Key Features
Classification and severity grading of diseases using advanced models such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Applications include breast cancer, pnemonia, covid, diabetic retinopathy, chroinic kidney dieases, and other imaging-based diagnostics.

Predictive models for early disease detection and risk stratification using structured clinical data.
Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure transparency and trust in diagnostic predictions.

Text analysis of electronic health records (EHRs) and medical reports.
Sentiment analysis and keyword extraction from patient data to understand care quality and trends.

Combining imaging, clinical, and genomic data to create holistic diagnostic tools.
Exploring advanced techniques for feature integration and model interpretability.
